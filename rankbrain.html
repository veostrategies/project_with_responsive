        <p>Google’s core algorithm which uses machine learning (the ability of machines to teach themselves from data
            inputs) to determine the most relevant results to search engine queries. Pre-RankBrain, Google utilized its
            basic algorithm to determine which results to show for a given query. Post-RankBrain, it is believed that
            the query now goes through an interpretation model that can apply possible factors like the location of the
            searcher, personalization, and the words of the query to determine the searcher’s true intent. By
            discerning this true intent, Google can deliver more relevant results.

            How do we comply with Google’s RankBrain?

        </p>
        <p>Here are 4 ways for marketers to comply and win with RankBrain’s ranking system:

            RankBrain prefers natural long-tail keyword phrases, which sound like smartphone voice searches – or the
            real questions that searchers ask or seek. RankBrain connects the dots between the search terms and the
            keyword phrases to guide users to website content matching the search request. Marketers using long-tail
            queries as their keyword phrases get RankBrains’s attention. A clear, concise and conclusive keyword
            strategy with primary keywords and associated long-tail phrases and queries conveying the content topic, is
            easily interpreted by RankBrain, leading to a highly ranked website in SERP.

        </p>
        <p> 2. It is now advisable to use Google AdWords Keyword Planner – a valuable tool that identifies the exact
            and apt keyword phrases to build relevant content. It generates a list that a marketer will find helpful to
            review and determine the essential vital topics around which meaningful content can be created. Using these
            keyword phrase suggestions provided by Google can help in understanding how the search engine links the
            questions. Moreover, content with Google-suggested keyword phrases will get better RankBrain ranking.

        </p>
        <p>3. Create natural relevance by writing unique, exciting and fact-based content that flows naturally and
            (yet strategically) with non-repetitive keywords and links that direct to complementary sources that
            enhance the idea and insights of the overall content. RankBrain loves content that is created keeping the
            user intent in mind - that the users will want to find in the websites.

        </p>
        <p>4. To own organic listings with remarkable click-through rates, it is imperative to tap into the readers’
            emotions. Emotions are one of the most powerful triggers that not only increase the clickthrough rate but
            also boost the conversion rate dramatically. To raise your CTR from ‘OK’ to ‘Great,’ you must combine the
            best of both worlds – powerful and influential emotional trigger + relevant keyword strategy
            RankBrain promotes content that is thoughtfully created answering users’ questions and solving their
            problems while leveraging a particular emotion.
            SEO is evolving each day, and AI and machine learning are adding new dimensions to what’s possible with
            search. Google has confirmed that RankBrain is continuously being applied to an increasing number of search
            queries and its AI processes all the questions that Google handles – which has humongous implications for
            your SEO strategy.
