            Question Answer page
            What is Search Engine Optimization (SEO)?
            Search Engine Optimization is the process of maximizing the number of visitors to a particular website by
            ensuring that the site appears high on the list of results returned by a search engine.
        </p>

        <p id="main">
            What is Voice-based Search Engine Optimization (VEO)?
            Once a web site is optimized for the essentials of (SEO), Voice-based search engine optimization (VEO) can
            be practiced. VEO includes the process of using conversational artificial intelligence (AI), by vocally or
            manually submitting a question, fragments of words, and or request. Once the submission is queried, the
            conversational AI will provide the most accurate and dominant answer/result to the individual submitting
            the query. VEO includes back-end SEO, machine learning, and conversational AI.

            <img class="image2" src="images/veo4.png" alt="How do we use voice search?"/>
        </div>
        <p>
            Once I have the basics of SEO, why is it important that I know VEO?
            It is important for your website to be voice-based search engine optimized so that individuals interacting
            with your site utilizing conversational AI will be provided with the most simplified search results for
            best user experience.

        <p>
            Now that you’ve made sure your site is equipped with SEO basics. Subject matter experts suggest that your
            website is accessible and inclusive in design on all search engines.
        </p>

        <p>
            How does machine learning in search work?
        </p>

        <p>
            Before moving forward and thinking of machine learning we must understand how search engines crawl, and
            index websites. We must understand how search engine algorithms function.
        </p>

        <p>
            Search engines treat user intent as ranking signals. We must know of their importance.
        </p>

        <p >
            What is user intent?
            User Intent

            User intent or query intent is the identification and categorization of what a user online intended or
            wanted when they typed their search terms into an online web search engine for the purpose of search engine
            optimization or conversion rate optimization. Also referenced at times as query intent.

            How does machine learning actually impact search and seo?

            We first must understand what Machine Learning is.

            Machine learning (ML) is the scientific study of algorithms and statistical models that computer systems
            use to progressively improve their performance on a specific task.

            Machine learning is not the same as artificial intelligence (AI).

            AI is the science behind creating systems that resemble human-like intelligence and process information in
            a similar manner. AI is also unpredictable in many ways. Regarding SEO/VEO the AI will be able to add new
            data and calculate new techniques depending on what is required from the search engine.

            We use machine learning to solve problems. Machine Learning works mathematically to produce the SEO
            techniques and solutions.

            Google’s search engine’s primary algorithm is RankBrain.
            RankBrain is an algorithm learning artificial intelligence system, the use of which was confirmed by Google
            on 26 October 2015. It helps Google to process search results and provide more relevant search results for
            users.

            The machine learning aspect of RankBrain is what sets it apart from other updates. To “teach” the RankBrain
            algorithm to produce useful search results, Google first “feeds” it’s data from a variety of sources. The
            algorithm then takes it from there, calculating and teaching itself over time to match a variety of signals
            to a variety of results and to order search engine rankings based on these calculations.

            Google’s core algorithm which uses machine learning (the ability of machines to teach themselves from data
            inputs) to determine the most relevant results to search engine queries. Pre-RankBrain, Google utilized its
            basic algorithm to determine which results to show for a given query. Post-RankBrain, it is believed that
            the query now goes through an interpretation model that can apply possible factors like the location of the
            searcher, personalization, and the words of the query to determine the searcher’s true intent. By
            discerning this true intent, Google can deliver more relevant results.

            How do we comply with Google’s RankBrain?

            Here are 4 ways for marketers to comply and win with RankBrain’s ranking system:

            RankBrain prefers natural long-tail keyword phrases, which sound like smartphone voice searches – or the
            real questions that searchers ask or seek. RankBrain connects the dots between the search terms and the
            keyword phrases to guide users to website content matching the search request. Marketers using long-tail
            queries as their keyword phrases get RankBrains’s attention. A clear, concise and conclusive keyword
            strategy with primary keywords and associated long-tail phrases and queries conveying the content topic, is
            easily interpreted by RankBrain, leading to a highly ranked website in SERP.

            2. It is now advisable to use Google AdWords Keyword Planner – a valuable tool that identifies the exact
            and apt keyword phrases to build relevant content. It generates a list that a marketer will find helpful to
            review and determine the essential vital topics around which meaningful content can be created. Using these
            keyword phrase suggestions provided by Google can help in understanding how the search engine links the
            questions. Moreover, content with Google-suggested keyword phrases will get better RankBrain ranking.

            3. Create natural relevance by writing unique, exciting and fact-based content that flows naturally and
            (yet strategically) with non-repetitive keywords and links that direct to complementary sources that
            enhance the idea and insights of the overall content. RankBrain loves content that is created keeping the
            user intent in mind - that the users will want to find in the websites.

            4. To own organic listings with remarkable click-through rates, it is imperative to tap into the readers’
            emotions. Emotions are one of the most powerful triggers that not only increase the clickthrough rate but
            also boost the conversion rate dramatically. To raise your CTR from ‘OK’ to ‘Great,’ you must combine the
            best of both worlds – powerful and influential emotional trigger + relevant keyword strategy
            RankBrain promotes content that is thoughtfully created answering users’ questions and solving their
            problems while leveraging a particular emotion.
            SEO is evolving each day, and AI and machine learning are adding new dimensions to what’s possible with
            search. Google has confirmed that RankBrain is continuously being applied to an increasing number of search
            queries and its AI processes all the questions that Google handles – which has humongous implications for
            your SEO strategy.

        ________

        <p>
            HTML coder or back-end developer who wants to know what it is that they should know about SEO. On-site SEO
            requires more than just an SEO expert. It's a team effort. It means getting multiple people involved,
            including a designer, and front- and back- end developers. Everyone must understand their role in building
            a search engine-friendly website. When building a website, these are the roles typically involved:
            The SEO strategist does the keyword research and plans the required landing pages based on what they know
            of the client's business goals and needs. They provide a list of pages that must be on the website as well
            as any front-end coding recommendations that are specific to the needs of a particular website.
            The information architect takes that information from the SEO strategist to then integrate that into their
            IA work for a website that is both usable and search engine-friendly.
            The designer creates an interface that translates the IA wireframes into a well-branded, effective
            communication tool that can handle the necessary content as specified for SEO purposes. The designer is
            also partly responsible for ensuring that the fonts they use that are crucial to the SEO project are
            machine-readable and that the page load time and bounce rates will not be negatively affected by a design
            element.
        </p>
        <p>
            The front-end coder must ensure that content is coded to in a search-engine friendly fashion.
            The back-end developer needs to ensure proper canonicalization of URLs and provide the tools necessary to
            help with SEO.
            SEO standards for Front-End Coders:
            To make it easy for front-end coders and back-end developers to have a list of items to consider when doing
            their part of the website building process, I've made a list of standards to go by:
            CSS vs Tables
            This shouldn't require mentioning, but websites should be using CSS rather than a table structure. This
            allows for improved ordering of content elements on the page. For example, being able to place a long left
            sidebar below rather than above a block of unique content would be nice. CSS allows that to happen.
            Usage of H tags and other style elements
            Limit the usage of H tags (H1, H2, H3, etc) and strong tags to non-repetitive content. That means don't use
            these HTML tags on site-wide headings, sidebars, footers, or anything that is repeated across the website
            or multiple pages. Instead, use a regular div. Reserve these tags for unique content on every page.
            Fonts as much as possible, use machine-readable fonts. An alternative is to use font-replacement such as
            @font-face. As a last resort, use an image to display text. Place the image in an image tag (rather than
            using CSS) with alt text that repeats what is written in the image, word-for-word.
            Images
        </p>
        <p id="content">
            For images that are stylistic elements, using CSS background images is fine, but for content elements,
            found within a body of text that is unique to a page, use a regular image tag. For logos, use an image tag
            rather than using text replacement, as seen here. http://css-tricks.com/rethinking-css-image-replacement/
            (see "The New Way"). Alt tags should contain the words seen in the image.
            Site speed
            A web page should not take more than 3 seconds to load on a 10Mb connection. The front-end coder is not
            responsible for the entirety of what makes a page fast or slow, but they do have a role to play. That means
            consolidating CSS and javascript files, loading javascript at the end of the page, creating sprites and
            seeking other size-cutting opportunities.
            Making content readable Search engines have trouble reading content that is within.
