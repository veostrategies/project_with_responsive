        SEO Standards for Back-End Developers
        Canonicalization
        A canonical URL is the version of any given web page's URL that we want indexed by search engines.
        Canonicalization is the process by which we achieve that result. Every page on a website should only be
        accessible from one URL. Additional URL parameters can be added, if handled using techniques described
        here.
    </p>
    <p>
        Dealing with www and index pages.
        By default, all of the following URLs should redirect to www.example.com
        example.com, example.com/index.(.*), www.example.com/index.(.*)
        There may be cases where a website owner prefers to use the non-www version or a subdomain as their root
        domain. That is fine as long as all other versions redirect to that chosen version.
        Dealing with trailing slashes
        URLs may have a trailing slash "/" at the end. Sometimes they do not. The server should always redirect to
        one or the other. Ideally, the version with the slash is preferred.
        Example: www.example.com/blue-widget should 301 redirect to www.example.com/blue-widget/
        Note that this is not an issue with root URLs, such as www.example.com. A slash will never appear at the
        end of that URL.
    </p>
    <p>
        Canonicalizing subpages
        A product page on an e-commerce website that is accessible at 3 different URLs is not a good idea. The
        example
        demonstrates a problem stemming from the CMS architecture. Ideally, there should only be one URL.
        /product/reebok-black-crossfit-shoe/ET256/
        /shoes/product/reebok-black-crossfit-shoe/ET256/
        /shoes/fitness/product/reebok-black-crossfit-shoe/ET256/
        In this case, where categories and subcategories appear to be constantly changing, the best URL to use is
        /product/reebok-black-crossfit-shoe/ET256/. No other URLs should open this page. It's okay to add
        parameters to
        the URL. For example, the existence of the following URLs is okay if the canonical link tag is used.
        /product/reebok-black-crossfit-shoe/ET256/
        /product/reebok-black-crossfit-shoe/ET256/?cat=shoes
        /product/reebok-black-crossfit-shoe/ET256/?cat=shoes&subcat=fitness
        For each of the URLs above, what's called the canonical link tag should be added to the
    </p>

    <p>
        When a website contains multiple sections, for example a Wordpress-controlled blog, and some other
        self-contained sections, it may be easier to generate a separate sitemap for each section. These can be
        linked to using a sitemap index file, as seen in this example: https://www.bluefountainmedia.com/sitemap.xml
        Updating of the robots.txt file the robots.txt file controls where search engine crawlers are allowed to go.
        This file should be editable
        via the CMS. Magento has a list of subdirectories that should be disallowed by default that should be included
        from the start. Editable page sections Although it is not an SEO requirement, it is beneficial for tracking
        purposes to be able to edit various
        parts of all web pages on the website. These include:
        Immediately after the opening head tag.
        Immediately before the closing head tag. Immediately after the
        openingbody tag.
        Immediately before the closing body tag.
        There are various tracking scripts that help in obtaining information about user behavior that need to be
        added to any of these areas. There should be a way to add a tag to all pages as well as each page individually.

    <img class="image" src="images/veo7.png" alt="How do we use voice search?" />
    </div>
    <p>
        Image uploads
        When images are uploaded via the CMS, file names should be editable rather than being rewritten to a random
        string by the CMS. Image titles and alt tags should be editable (they usually are in most content
        management systems).
    </p>
    <p id="content">
        Page speed
        To optimize page load time, various back-end load time cutting techniques should be employed, a long list
        of which can be found here: http://gtmetrix.com/recommendations.html. Pages should not take more than 3
        seconds to load.

    <p>
        404 configuration
        When a random URL is accessed, the server should return a 404 response - not a 302, 200 or any other.
